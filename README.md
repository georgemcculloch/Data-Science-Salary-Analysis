# GitHub Portfolio Project: Data Science Salaries Analysis 2023 ðŸ’¸
## [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/georgemcculloch/datasalaries/blob/main/data%20salaries.ipynb)


Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data science salaries in the year 2023. The dataset contains information about various data science fields, including job titles, salary amounts, currencies, experience levels, employment types, remote work ratios, and company locations. The project aims to explore salary distributions, identify trends based on experience and job titles, and examine the impact of factors such as employment type and remote work on salaries.

Project Goals:

1. Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset, identify any missing values or outliers, and gain insights into salary distributions.
2. Salary Analysis: Analyze salary ranges for different data science job titles and experience levels. Identify high-paying roles and examine the relationship between salaries and other variables such as currency and employee residence.
3. Employment Analysis: Investigate the distribution of employment types (e.g., full-time, part-time) among data science roles and analyze how it relates to salary variations.
4. Remote Work Analysis: Examine the proportion of remote work opportunities in data science jobs and explore how remote work impacts salary levels.
5. Company Location Analysis: Analyze the geographical distribution of data science job opportunities and compare salaries across different company locations.
6. Data Visualization: Create visually appealing and informative plots, charts, and interactive visualizations to present the findings from the salary analysis.

Skills and Tools Utilized:

1. Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
2. Jupyter Notebook: Provide a clear and reproducible analysis workflow.
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform necessary transformations.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Generate summary statistics, visualize data distributions, and identify correlations between variables.
5. Statistical Analysis: Analyze salary ranges, employment types, and remote work ratios using descriptive statistics and inferential methods.
6. Data Visualization: Create interactive visualizations, plots, and dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
7. GitHub: Showcase the project, code, and findings in a well-organized repository, including a README file describing the project and its objectives.
